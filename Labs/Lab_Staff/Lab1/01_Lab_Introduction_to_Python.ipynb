    "Just like any languages such as C/C++, Python allowed programmer to group statement into reusable function moduels. A function is a block of organized, reusable code that is used to perform a single, related action. Functions provide better modularity for your application and a high degree of code reusing.\n",

    "\n",
    "Function blocks begin with the keyword def followed by the function name and parentheses ( ( ) ).\n",

    "Any input parameters or arguments should be placed within these parentheses. You can also define parameters inside these parentheses.\n",

    "```python\n",

    "## Pass by reference and value?\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common evaluation strategy when passing arguments to a function has been call by value and call by reference:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Call by Value \n",
    "The most common strategy is the call-by-value evaluation, sometimes also called pass-by-value. This strategy is used in C and C++, for example. In call-by-value, the argument expression is evaluated, and the result of this evaluation is bound to the corresponding variable in the function. So, if the expression is a variable, a local copy of its value will be used, i.e. the variable in the caller's scope will be unchanged when the function returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Call by Reference\n",
    "In call-by-reference evaluation, which is also known as pass-by-reference, a function gets an implicit reference to the argument, rather than a copy of its value. As a consequence, the function can modify the argument, i.e. the value of the variable in the caller's scope can be changed. The advantage of call-by-reference consists in the advantage of greater time- and space-efficiency, because arguments do not need to be copied. On the other hand this harbours the disadvantage that variables can be \"accidentally\" changed in a function call. So special care has to be taken to \"protect\" the values, which shouldn't be changed. \n",
    "\n",
    "Many programming language support call-by-reference, like C or C++, but Perl uses it as default.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is neither of them. Python initially behaves like call-by-reference, but as soon as we are changing the value of such a variable, Python \"switches\" to call-by-value if the variable is an immutable object.\n",
    "\n",
    "A mutable object exhibits time-varying behavior. Changes to a mutable object are visible through all names bound to it. Python's lists are an example of mutable objects. An immutable object does not exhibit time-varying behavior. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the example below, we used the id() function, which takes an object as a parameter. id(obj) returns the \"identity\" of the object \"obj\". This identity, the return value of the function, is an integer which is unique and constant for this object during its lifetime. Two different objects with non-overlapping lifetimes may have the same id() value.\n"
